### Projects Title
Deforestation Exploration
Udiddit, a Social News Aggregator

### Description
This repository contains the two project submissions I used to graduate from Udacity's SQL Nanodegree Program.

- The first project required completing a report for a made-up non-profit organization dedicated to reducing deforestation around the world. The report was missing key information that had to be retrieved from the database and required the student to make a business recommendation based on the available data. 
The final "Appendix" section shows the queries I wrote to complete the project. 

- The second project required analyzing a made-up social news aggregator website's database schema and highlighting its potential issues and inefficiencies. The student then had to create a new, optimized schema and migrate the data from the old one to the new one. The document shows three suggestions I made to improve the database schema and all the queries I wrote to complete the project.
